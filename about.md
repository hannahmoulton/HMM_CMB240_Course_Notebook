Hello! My name is Hannah and I am currently an undergraduate student at the University of Rhode Island. In May 2021, I will graduate with a bachelor's degree in pharmaceutical sciences. Post-graduation, I am looking forward to entering the workforce in the pharmaceutical industry. 

I am dedicated to open, rigorous, and reproducible experiments and analyses.
